This is a repository to show all of the design documents for the Devo Quotes App for the BYU-Idaho Hack Week 2021

In early October 2021 I was walking through the Science & Technology Center and as I turned the corner into the lobby I noticed a large gathering and lots of commotion. Students gathered around in small groups chattering all at once; feeling intrigued I eavesdropped on a couple of nearby conversations to learn that the gathering was for the 2021 Hack Week competition. The presentation started shortly thereafter and I watched as the competition was explained and individuals presented their project ideas and personal skills. 

As I listened to the idea and skills pitches, a feeling of inadequacy overcame me. I had no intention to participate before I walked into that room, but as I continued to listen to the different ideas and the confidence that the other students exhibited I overcame my feeling of inadequacy and I filled myself with initiative, inspiration, pride, and grit to achieve. My mind affirmed “why shouldn’t I participate? I am an excellent software engineer and I can be of value. I can even win! Who’s going to stop me? If they can do it why not me?” So I joined a team. 

I choose my team because I strongly believed in the goal of the project; I believe in the importance of attending BYU-Idaho devotionals and wanted to be part of a project that would enhance that experience. The thought that someday my future kids would ask about the projects I was most proud to have worked on drove me to join the team; I want my kids to know that my name was on that development team so I joined and I offered my skills. 

What the team needed at that point was someone who shared the vision of the team lead. We had skilled programmers but we needed someone to buy into the vision of what the app could become—I was that person, so I offered the team what I do best: design.
